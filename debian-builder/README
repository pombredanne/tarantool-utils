webdav server (sitecopy, see ~/.sitecopyrc).

builder - tarantool debian package builder.

builder/manager.sh - per-instances builder.sh wrapper.
builder/base - pbuilder distribution images.
builder/build - builder defined instances.

debian - reprepro debian repository.
debian-stable - reprepro debian repository for stable releases.
